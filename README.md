# Netflix-clone-phishing-site


📧 Phishing Awareness Campaign – Netflix Clone Project
This project simulates a phishing attack using a fake Netflix login page in a secure, offline environment. It is intended to raise awareness about phishing techniques and help users identify fake websites that attempt to steal login credentials.

📝 Project Overview
This awareness campaign demonstrates how a cloned login page can trick users into entering their credentials.

The project includes:

A cloned Netflix login interface.

A PHP script that captures entered credentials.

A sample redirection or awareness message after login.

Optional supporting materials: poster, slides, and script.

📌 Purpose: To educate users about phishing attacks through simulation.

📁 Files Included
File / Folder	Purpose
index.html	Fake Netflix login page (entry point)
login.php	Captures and stores credentials in a log file
login_log.txt	Logs the login attempts for awareness review
style.css	Custom styling to match Netflix branding

🚨 Disclaimer
This project is intended strictly for educational and internal awareness training.
Do not deploy this site online, send real phishing emails, or collect real credentials.
Phishing is a criminal offense if done without consent or in real-world scenarios.

✅ How It Works
The user opens the fake login page (index.html).

If they enter any email/password, the data is saved to saved.txt using login.php.

After login, you can optionally redirect them to an awareness message like:

"You just entered your credentials on a fake site. This was a demo to raise phishing awareness."

💡 Objective
This phishing simulation is designed to:

🎯 Show how attackers mimic trusted websites like Netflix.

🛡️ Teach users how to detect phishing attempts (URL mismatch, no HTTPS, etc.).

💬 Encourage safe internet practices like verifying site addresses and enabling 2FA.

📢 Be part of a cybersecurity campaign (along with posters, slides, and video).
